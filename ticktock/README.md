# ticktock

This ZIP contains a skeleton Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind project (ticktock) with mocked NextAuth credentials and mocked timesheet data.

How to run:
1. unzip the folder
2. run `npm install`
3. create an `.env.local` with NEXTAUTH_SECRET (or copy from .env.local.example)
4. run `npm run dev`

Note: This is a mock setup using in-memory data. It's intended for local development/preview.
